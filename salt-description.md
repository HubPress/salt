# HubPress <small>A web application to build your blog on GitHub</small>

## What is HubPress?

[HubPress](http://hubpress.io) is a blogging tool powered by [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) and [Asciidoctor](http://asciidoctor.org). The goal of HubPress is similiar to [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), [Octopress](http://octopress.org) or [Awestruct](http://awestruct.org): to build static content on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com). What sets HubPress apart from these tools is that we wanted to provide a tool that is more **user-friendly** and **accessible** for **everyone**.

[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) requires a non-trivial amount of technical knowledge to configure and get to a working blog site, particulary if you want to use AsciiDoc as the language you write your content in. At a minimum, you need the following pre-requisite knowledge, or be able to learn it quickly:

- Understand how to use Git.
- Learn how to install and configure Ruby.
- Choose from a myriad of static site generators and technologies.
- Understand the build process of each static site builder, all of which differ slightly.

For the avearage person who just wants to write and share their thoughts, this list alone makes them turn away from a GitHub Pages solution and look to other "just use it" solutions such as WordPress, Medium, and Blogger.

With [HubPress](http://hubpress.io) all you need is an Internet connection and a GitHub account and you can start blogging within a few minutes. To save or publish a post, one click in the editing interface is all that is required. HubPress takes all the rough edges out of the GitHub Pages blogging experience, and makes it as easy as using something like Blogger or WordPress.

Because we love the **AsciiDoc** markup format, we wanted a way to introduce folks to the benefits of the markup language, while simultaneously contributing to the adoption of AsciiDoc as a writing format for professional writers and bloggers.

These are the reasons why we made [HubPress](http://hubpress.io).

[HubPress](http://hubpress.io) is:

1. **Easy to use**: no technical skills required.
2. **Free**: no subscription, and you donâ€™t have to pay rent for a server.
3. **Yours**: once HubPress is forked installed in your GitHub repository, you can do as you please with it.

[HubPress](http://hubpress.io) is inspired by [Ghost](http://ghost.org) and uses part of its code to render your blog.
To provide a better user experience, we made a web interface based on [Asciidoctor](http://asciidoctor.org) with [Asciidoctor.js](https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor.js), which is the javascript version.

## Why we need your help?

Originally, HubPress started out as a proof of concept with Asciidoctor.js and IndexDB. However, With the overwhelming adoption of the platform (over 1600 unique forks on GitHub), HubPress is becoming harder to support and maintain in a way that will allow it to grow and evolve.
