# HubPress <small>A web application to build your blog on GitHub</small>

## What is HubPress?

[HubPress](http://hubpress.io) is a blogging tool powered by [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) and [Asciidoctor](http://asciidoctor.org). As [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), [Octopress](http://octopress.org) or [Awestruct](http://awestruct.org), the goal of [HubPress](http://hubpress.io) is to build static content on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com).

These tools are really great, but we wanted to provide a tool that is more **user-friendly** and **accessible** for **everyone**. Another reason is because we love the **AsciiDoc** markup and we wanted a way to contribute to its development.

That’s why we made [HubPress](http://hubpress.io).

With the usual tools building a blog on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) requires a decent amount of technical knowledge (you need to know git, to install ruby, to learn a build process ...).

To provide a better user experience, we made a web interface based on [Asciidoctor](http://asciidoctor.org) with [Asciidoctor.js](https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor.js), the javascript version.

With [HubPress](http://hubpress.io) all you need is an internet connection and a GitHub account, that’s it!

To save or publish a post, just one click is necessary. We focus on accessibility, you just have to focus on writing.

[HubPress](http://hubpress.io) is :

1. **Easy to use**: no technical skills required,
2. **Free**: no subscription, you don’t have to pay rent for a server,
3. **Yours**: once HubPress is installed in your repository GitHub, you can live alone if you want.

[HubPress](http://hubpress.io) is inspired by [Ghost](http://ghost.org) and use a part of its code to render your blog.
